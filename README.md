# Rebirth
An app that lets you create desktop executables from your favourite web apps. Currently only working for Windows and Linux. Both the program itself and the apps that are created using this program are built with Tauri. 

# Dependencies
For both operating systems there are some build dependencies that needs to be installed before using the program. These are needed as the program itself actually builds the desktop app from scratch. More info on these can be found at https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites
