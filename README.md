# Rebirth
An app that lets you create desktop executables from your favourite web apps. Currently only working for Windows and Linux.

# Dependencies
- Rust (1.72 or later)

For both operating systems there are some more build dependencies that needs to be installed before using the program. These are needed as the program itself actually builds the desktop app from scratch. More info at https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites
